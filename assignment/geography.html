          Nepal is located in South Asia and stretches approximately from the 26th to the 30th northern latitude and from the 80th to 88th eastern longitude. Nepal covers an area of 147,516 square kilometers,of which about 143,000 square kilometers are land area and the remaining 4,000 square kilometers are inland waters. The east-west extension is 885 kilometers, and the maximum north-south extent reached in western Nepal is about 241 kilometers. Nepal is located between the Tibet region in the north and India in the south. Nepal borders (from west to east) the Indian states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and the former Kingdom of Sikkim, which acceded to the Indian Union.Its territory is usually divided into three zones: the mountain, the hills and the Terai areas. These ecological rings expanded in an east-west direction are cut by the basin of the various rivers that are born in the mountains.<br>
          Himal is the mountain region containing snow and situated in the Great Himalayan Range; it makes up the northern part of Nepal. It contains the highest elevations in the world including 8,848.86 metres (29,032 ft) height Mount Everest (Sagarmāthā in Nepali) on the border with China. Seven other of the world's "eight-thousanders" are in Nepal or on its border with Tibet: Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu, Kangchenjunga, Dhaulagiri, Annapurna and Manaslu. Pahad is the mountain region that does not generally contain snow. The mountains vary from 800 to 4,000 metres (2,600 to 13,100 ft) in altitude, with progression from subtropical climates below 1,200 metres (3,900 ft) to alpine climates above 3,600 metres (11,800 ft). The Lower Himalayan Range, reaching 1,500 to 3,000 metres (4,900 to 9,800 ft), is the southern limit of this region, with subtropical river valleys and "hills" alternating to the north of this range. Population density is high in valleys but notably less above 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) and very low above 2,500 metres (8,200 ft), where snow occasionally falls in winter. The southern lowland plains or Terai bordering India are part of the northern rim of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Terai is the lowland region containing some hill ranges. The plains were formed and are fed by three major Himalayan rivers: the Koshi, the Narayani, and the Karnali as well as smaller rivers rising below the permanent snowline. This region has a subtropical to tropical climate. The outermost range of the foothills called Sivalik Hills or Churia Range, cresting at 700 to 1,000 metres (2,300 to 3,280 ft), marks the limits of the Gangetic Plain. Broad, low valleys called Inner Terai Valleys (Bhitri Tarai Upatyaka) lie north of these foothills in several places.<br>
          Nepal has five climatic zones, closely linked to the height of the territory. The tropical and subtropical zone are under 1200 meters. The temperate climate is between 1200 and 2400 m, while the cold zone is between 2400 and 3600 meters. The subarctic zone covers between 3600 and 4400 m, and from this last height the Arctic zone begins. Nepal has five seasons, summer, monsoon, autumn, winter and spring.
