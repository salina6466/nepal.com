        Nepal is a secular country, as declared by the Constitution of Nepal 2012 (Part 1, Article 4), where secularism 'means religious, cultural freedom, along with the protection of religion, culture handed down from time immemorial.According to the 2011 census, 81.34% of the population are members of Hinduism. Nepal was the only country where Hinduism was the state religion until parliament professed secularism after the king's ouster in April 2006.  9.04% of the population is designated as Buddhist (especially in Mustang). Lumbini, located on the border with India, is traditionally considered the birthplace of Buddha. The larger minorities include 4.39% Muslims and 3.05% followers of Kirant Mundhum, an animistic denomination recognized as a religion.
        The proportion of Christians in Nepal was 1.42% in 2011. In addition, there are 0.76% Other.Other small minorities are Sikhs, whose number in 2011 was over 7000.<br>
        Among other natives of Nepal, the most influenced by Hinduism were Magar, Sunwar, Limbu, Rai and the Gurkhas. Hindu influence is less prominent among gurung, Bhutia, and Thakali groups that employ Buddhist monks for their religious ceremonies. Most of the festivals in Nepal are Hindu.Nepal has the second-largest number of Hindus in the world after India.  <br>
        Many Hindu temples in Kathmandu and the surrounding districts are centuries old with some of them of great national importance to Hindus such as the Pashupatinath temple, the Changu Narayan (the oldest) or the Kasthamandap. Among the Hindu temples we can also mention the Bajrayogini temple, the Dakshinkali, the Guhyeshwari and the Sobha Baghwati shrine.<br>
        The Bagmati River, which flows through Kathmandu, is considered a sacred river by both Hindus and Buddhists, and many Hindu temples are located on the banks of this river. The importance of this watercourse also lies in the fact that Hindus are incinerated on the banks of this sacred river, and kirants are buried in the hills of its banks. According to Nepali Hindu tradition, the corpse must be submerged three times in the Bagmati River before cremation.<br>
         the Christian population is a minority. Christian churches were established only since 1950, after multiparty democracy was instituted, despite efforts in the nineteenth century to bring Christianity to Nepal. The New Testament was translated into Nepali in 1821 and the complete Bible in 1914. It is said that in Kathmandu alone there are about 170 Christian churches.
